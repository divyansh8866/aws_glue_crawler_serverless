In this project we have code wich can delete update and get all the crawlers at once, therefore making things simple. We can also do the collowing task with glue workflow but there we have limit on the number of crawlers that we can fire therefore we need this project and code. Following code template is designed to ron on a specific time and day. make changes as per need. ;-) Enjoy.
